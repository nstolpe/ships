### Turning Equation

* Mz: Turning moment of ship arount z axis (steering axis, yaw):

	* F = force applied to rudder, in Newtons

	* d = distance from turning point (z-axis, where the rudder is attached) to end. Length of rudder?

* L/2: distance of rudder from turning axis

* v: current linear velocity of the ship to water, so includes velocity offset by current.

	* meters per second?

* w: rotational velocity of ship around z axis, radians per second (CCW)

* p0, p1, p2 coefficients of angular friction for water

	p0 = constant coefficient of angular friction

	p1 = linear coefficient of angular friction

	p2 = quadratic coefficient of angular friction

* A: area of rudder

* d: density of water

* theta: rudder angle measured CCW from straight back, radians

* heading: boat heading measured CCW from origin direction (y:0, x:0), radians

* delta-t: time interval

* Cd: coefficient of increased drag from non-neutral rudder
